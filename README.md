### Hi there, I'm Nils ðŸ‘‹

I hope my tools and programs are also helpful for you.
Most of the stuff are Bash scripts or Perl utilities.
I'm more Ops than Dev and always happy to receive pull requests.

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyclenerd/).
Feel free to send me a connection request.
